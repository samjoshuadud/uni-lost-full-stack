# Project Name

## Getting Started

I deleted Node Modules and .next since Node Modules have big files I cannot upload in github. 

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

This will install all the necessary packages defined in the package.json file.
